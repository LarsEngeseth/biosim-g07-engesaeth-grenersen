What is Biosim
==============

Biosim will simulate the ecosystem on the beautiful island named Rosumøya. |br|
Rosumøya is located in the middle of the vast ocean that belongs to the island |br|
nation of Pylandia. Rosumøya has four different landscapes: |br|
Lowland - contains lots of plants |br|
Highlands - contains minimal amount of plants |br|
Dessert - contains no plants |br|
Water - non-accessible area for any animal |br|

Rosumøya is also home to two unknown species, one is a herbivore (plant eater) and the
other is a carnivore (predator). The herbivore will feed on the plants in the different landscape, while the
carnivore will feed on the herbovires.

In our simulation, both species have the ability to age, gain weight through eating plants
or hunting, loose weight, give birth, migrate to a different part on the island, and die.

Why we created Biosim
---------------------
The Environmental Protection Agency of Pylandia (EPAP) encourages research groups to
develop computer programs for the simulation of population dynamics on |br|
Rossumøya. We decided we wanted to give this challenge a try, and the result is the package Biosim.
