Description: The Biosim Project
        ==================
        
        Welcome to the biosim project.
        With this package you can simulate the ecosystem on the island named Rossumøya.
        The ecosystem consists of two unknown species, where one is a herbivore and
        the other is a carnivore.
        The island also consists of four different landscapes: Lowlands, highlands, desert and water.
        Lowlands has lots of plants and is a perfect spot for the herbivore.
        Higlands has minimal amounts of food, so fewer herbivores can live here.
        Desert as no food, and herbivores can't live here long-term.
        Water is non-habitable since neither of the two species can swim.
        The carnivore will naturally live where there are herbivores for them to eat.
        
        For more info on how to use the package, see the documentation for the project in the docs directory.
